# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This is my take on the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata. I first did it with Python and later added the C++ version.

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

## Better Code Hub

This code has been analysed by [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com). For reference, the original score before refactoring was 5.
